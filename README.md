##Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Web Application
This project is a web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on various patient parameters. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting medical data and visualizes the prediction results, including probabilities, using a modern and responsive design.

Features
Intuitive Data Input: A comprehensive form allows users to enter 24 different medical parameters.

Real-time Prediction: Submits data to a Flask backend for immediate prediction.

Visualized Probabilities: Displays prediction outcomes (CKD Detected / No CKD) with a dynamic pie chart showing the probability distribution.

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).

Enhanced Styling: Modern UI with a relevant background image, subtle hover effects, and clear visual feedback for results.

Error Handling: Provides user-friendly messages for network errors or unexpected server responses.

Technologies Used
Backend:

Python: The core programming language.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the API and serving the frontend.

Scikit-learn (assumed): For the machine learning model that performs the prediction.

Pandas (assumed): For data handling and preparation within the backend.

Frontend:

HTML5: Structure of the web pages.

CSS3: Styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+): Client-side interactivity, form handling, and API communication.

Chart.js: A powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive charts, used here for the pie chart visualization.

Project Structure
The project follows a typical Flask application structure:

chronic-kidney-disease-prediction/
├── templates/
│   └── index.html              # The main HTML template for the web application
├── static/
│   ├── style.css               # Stylesheet for the frontend
│   ├── script.js               # JavaScript for frontend logic and API calls
│   └── background.jpg          # (Optional) The background image for the application
├── app.py                      # Flask application backend logic (prediction API)
├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
└── README.md                   # This README file

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/FARDeen9307/chronic-kidney-disease-prediction.git
cd chronic-kidney-disease-prediction

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:
Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in your root directory listing all Python dependencies (e.g., Flask, scikit-learn, pandas). If you don't have one, create it and add the necessary libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(If you don't have requirements.txt, you might need to manually install: pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas)

Place the background image (Optional):
If you want to use the recommended background image, download it (e.g., from Pexels) and save it as background.jpg inside the static/ folder.

Run the Flask application:

flask run

or

python app.py

The application will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/.

Usage
Open your web browser and navigate to the address where the Flask application is running (e.g., http://localhost:5000/).

Fill in the required medical parameters in the form fields.

Click the "Predict" button.

The prediction result (Chronic Kidney Disease Detected / No Chronic Kidney Disease) will be displayed, along with a pie chart visualizing the prediction probabilities.

API Endpoint
The frontend communicates with the following backend API endpoint:

POST /predict:

Request Body: A JSON object containing the 24 medical parameters (e.g., {"age": 39, "bp": 80, ...}).

Response Body: A JSON object containing the prediction result and probabilities (e.g., {"prediction": 0, "probabilities": {"ckd": 0.15, "non_ckd": 0.85}}).

(Note: Ensure your app.py is set up to handle this POST request and return the prediction and probabilities in the specified format for the chart to work correctly.)

Future Enhancements
Model Retraining/Updates: Implement a mechanism to easily update or retrain the machine learning model.

User Authentication: Add user accounts to save prediction history or personalize insights.

Detailed Explanations: Provide more context or explanations for each input field.

Confidence Scores: Display confidence scores for predictions more prominently.

More Visualizations: Add other types of charts or graphs for data insights.

Input Validation: Implement more robust client-side and server-side input validation.

Dockerization: Containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment.

Database Integration: Store user inputs and predictions in a database.
